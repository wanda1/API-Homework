# API-Homework
This code requires a .env containing API keys (Alpaca API and Quandl API)</br>
when creating your .env file, try to have the file type as "No File Extension" and have it formatted something similar to this:</br>
ALPACA_API_KEY = 'Insert key here'</br></br>

ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = 'insert secret key here'</br></br>

QUANDL_API_KEY = 'insert key here'</br></br>

I will insert an empty .env file to make the process easier, then all you will have to do is insert your keys, this is a crucial step in order for the code to work.
